## New to Linux?

If you're new to Linux, we can help you to get started. Linux is an open source operating system with many different versions due to the nature of being open source and fully customizable. The different versions of Linux are called "distributions" (sometimes shortened to “distros”). You will first need to decide on a Linux distro that you want to run. You will next need to decide the install method you prefer - running Linux integrated with Windows (using Windows Subsystem for Linux), running Linux on a Virtual Machine (either locally with a hypervisor or in the cloud with Azure), or running bare-metal Linux (using a bootable USB and dual-booting if you need to run another system).

For step-by-step guidance on how to get started, see [How to download and install Linux](./install.md).

## Linux-related training at Microsoft

A variety of Linux-related training is available from Microsoft, ranging from Beginner to Advanced levels of expertise.
