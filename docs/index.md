## New to Linux?

If you're new to Linux, we can help you to get started. Linux is an open source operating system with many different versions due to the nature of being open source and fully customizable. The different versions of Linux are called "distributions" (sometimes shortened to “distros”). Check out our guide on [How to download and install Linux](install.md) that covers how to:

- [Choose a Linux distribution](install.md#step-2---choose-a-linux-distribution)
- [Use the install Linux command with Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](install.md#install-linux-with-windows-subsystem-for-linux)
- [Create a Linux Virtual Machine (VM) in the cloud](install.md#create-a-linux-virtual-machine-in-the-cloud)
- [Create a Linux Virtual Machine (VM) on your local machine](install.md#create-a-linux-virtual-machine-locally-using-a-hypervisor)
- [Create a bootable USB to install bare-metal Linux](install.md#create-a-bootable-usb-drive-to-install-bare-metal-linux)
